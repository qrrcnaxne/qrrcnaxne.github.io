Usually I rarely publish anything that I write. The purpose of this site is to try change that. \
This blog is structured in 2 sections, and I might add more should my enthusiasm permit. 
 * First is the front page, which is a blog about random meta things. I'm not exactly sure what I can write here. But it's bad look for the front page to be empty. 
 * Second is the `/rust` section that you'll find on top right corner of the site. This is a blog about rust. A programming language that I'm into as a hobby.
 * Third is the `/blog` section that is catchall for everything that doesn't belong in the first 2 sections. Mostly a formal style professional and tech blog.
