# This is a test header 

## Is is another test header or a sub header? 

### This is a sub sub header

Here's some rust code
```rust
fn main() {
    println!("Hello, world!");
}
```

This is a blog post which tries to figure out how to write a blog post. I am using an SSG called zola and it's theme called abridge. The site is hosted on github. Github has a nifty feature of hosting static websites, like a blog, resume, anything that can be hosted statically. Which is a lot.
I do not know where to take this text that I'm writing so I will just keep on writing what comes to my mind for the sake of a post.
