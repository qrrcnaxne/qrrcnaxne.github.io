# Purpose?

I fist took up writing in 2015. Someone told me it's a skill worth honing because there is no profession where this skill will go to waste. And it wasn't just about writing. The larger idea was being able to communicate through a variety of mediums. \
To that end I started writing fiction and poems. It was bad. Most of the content I've written in the past does not exist and has been deleted. In any art form it's a sign of progress that you can look back and cringe at your own filth. The harder you cringe, the more you've progressed. 

Translating this fiction and poem style writing into professional and teaching style was straightforward. But I've always received a better feedback for fiction than I have for tech stuff. Oh well. 

I have had blogs hosted on many platforms. First I started with wordpress, and a different blog on blogger. Then I wrote on quora and a little on medium. All that is gone now, and only wordpress remains for nostalgia reasons. 

One of the central benefits of writing is to have an extension for my brain. I can tell myself that I've written this down somewhere, now I don't need to remember it. 
Another one is articulation. Being able to articulate something means I understand it right. That there are no holes in my train of thought. 

Whenever I've learnt something new, there is an ideal image in my mind of how I could've learnt it in the best and most efficient way possible. 
Not to undermine any content in the wild, there are some incredible educators out there who make me red hot envious of their communication skills. 
Writing is a journey for me to walk in that same direction. Using myself as a reference for how best to communicate. 
I realize there is a bias in this idea. Nothing creative can thrive without feedback. But I'll just roll with it. 

The purpose of this one more blog is all of that. And I also wanted to migrate over my wordpress content, but I've since changed my mind and want to keep this as something I can show people in a professional context.  

I quite like the idea of owning my content, in the sense I always have a local copy of everything I write. Markdown is fairly portable. And even losing my local content means it's all available just a `git clone` away. And there are no ads here.
