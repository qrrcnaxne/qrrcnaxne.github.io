# Purpose?

I fist took up writing in 2015. Someone told me it's a skill worth honing because there is no profession where this skill will go waste.

To that end I started writing journals, fiction and poems. It was bad. Most of the content I've written in the past does not exist and has been deleted. In any art form it's a sign of progress that you can look back and cringe at your own filth. The harder you cringe, the more you've progressed. 

Translating this journaling, fiction and poem style writing into professional and teaching style wasn't straightforward. I've always received a better feedback for fiction than I have for tech stuff. Oh well. 

One of the central benefits of writing is to have an extension for my brain. I can tell myself that I've written this down somewhere, now I don't need to remember it. 
Another one is articulation. Being able to articulate something means I understand it right. 

Whenever I've learnt something new, there is an ideal image in my mind of how I could've learnt it in the best and most efficient way possible. 
Not to undermine any content in the wild, there are some incredible educators out there who make me red hot envious of their communication skills. 
Writing is a journey for me to walk in that same direction. Using myself as a reference for how best to communicate. 
I realize there is a bias in this idea. Nothing creative can thrive without feedback. But I'll just roll with it. 

The purpose of this blog is all of that.

I quite like the idea of owning my content, in the sense I always have a local copy of everything I write. Markdown is fairly portable. And even losing my local content means it's all available just a `git clone` away. And there are no ads here.
