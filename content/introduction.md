# Old Purpose

The initial idea of this blog was to create a central place for all my content to belong. That idea did not pan out.
Not in an impractical sense that I can't do it. I have hidden away all my old content and can't read it now without cringing like I just ate the sourest lemon. 
As it stands right now it is sitting idle. Well so what do I do?

# New purpose

I have decided to just roll with my efforts at whatever I'm currently doing tech related and write about it. This is a fresh new blog. 
I quite like the idea of owning my content in the sense I always have a local copy of everything I write. And markdown is fairly portable. And even losing my local content means it's all available just a `git clone` away.

# So what's it about?

The central idea is this. When I've learnt something, there is an ideal image in my mind of how I could've learnt it in the best and most efficient way possible. 
Not to undermine any content in the wild, there are some incredible educators out there who make me red hot envious of their comunication skills. 
Writing is a journey for me to walk in that same direction. Using myself as a reference of how to communicate. 
I realise there is a bias in this idea. Nothing creative can thrive without feedback. But I'll roll with it for now since there is no meaning to this madness anyway.
